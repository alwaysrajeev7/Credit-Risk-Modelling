## Key Banking Terms

### Disbursed Amount (DA)
- The total loan amount given to a borrower.

#### Examples:

1. **Personal Loans:** If a bank approves a personal loan for $10,000, and the entire amount is transferred to the borrower's account, then the disbursed amount is $10,000.

2. **Mortgages:** When a mortgage loan is approved for the purchase of a house, the disbursed amount is the total loan amount transferred to the seller or their representative.

3. **Business Loans:** If a business secures a loan of $50,000 to purchase new equipment, the disbursed amount is the full $50,000 provided to the business for that purpose.

4. **Credit Cards:** When a credit card issuer grants a credit limit to a cardholder, any transactions made using the card constitute disbursed amounts until they are repaid.

5. **Student Loans:** For student loans, the disbursed amount is the portion of the loan that is actually paid out to the educational institution to cover tuition, fees, and other approved expenses.

### Outstanding Principal (OSP)
- **Definition:** It represents the portion of the loan amount that the borrower still owes to the lender. As loan payments are made over time, the outstanding principal decreases.

- **Key Note:** OSP should be zero at the end of the loan cycle.

### Days Past Due (DPD)
- **Definition:** A borrower is defaulted if DPD > 0.

### Portfolio at Risk (PAR)
- **Definition:** The total OSP for loans where DPD > 0.


## Loan Classification Stages

### Days Past Due (DPD)

- **Definition:** The number of days a borrower has exceeded the due date for a loan payment.
- **Example:** If a borrower's payment was due on the 1st but remains unpaid by the 15th, they are 15 days past due.




### Non-Performing Asset (NPA)
- **Definition:** A loan becomes an NPA if the borrower misses payments for 90 days or more.
- **Example:** A borrower who hasn't paid in 90 days will have their loan classified as an NPA.

### Standard Monitoring Account(SMA)
- **Definition:** SMA stands for Standard Monitoring Account, which is a category used by banks to identify accounts that may be experiencing financial difficulties. It's an early warning system for lenders.
- **Example:** If a borrower frequently delays payments or shows financial stress, the loan may be classified as an SMA.

### Write-off
- **Definition:** When a bank marks a loan **unrecoverable**
- **Example:** After exhausting all recovery options, including legal action, the bank may write off the loan.


## Credit Risk Types in Banking

| **DPD Range**  | **Loan Status**                                 | **Remarks**                     |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **0 Days**     | NDA (Non-Delinquent Account)                    | No default, timely EMI payments |
| **1-30 Days**  | SMA1 (Standard Monitoring Account 1)            | Initial monitoring required     |
| **31-60 Days** | SMA2 (Standard Monitoring Account 2)            | Moderate risk level             |
| **61-90 Days** | SMA3 (Standard Monitoring Account 3)            | High risk of default            |
| **90-180 Days**| NPA (Non-Performing Asset) | Loan has defaulted |                                 |
| **>180 Days**  | Written-off | Loan considered unrecoverable     |                                 |


## GNPA (Gross Non-Performing Assets)

- **Definition:** the total value of a bank's non-performing assets (NPAs) before accounting for any provisions.

- **Calculation:** GNPA = Total value of all NPAs.

- **Significance:** GNPA gives a more accurate view of a bank's financial health regarding bad loans because it shows the actual potential losses if borrowers default on their NPAs.

## NNPA (Net Non-Performing Assets)

- **Definition:** The portion of a bank's non-performing assets (NPAs) that remains after deducting provisions set aside for potential losses.

- **Calculation:** NNPA = Gross NPAs - Provisions


## Let's say a bank has the following figures:

- Gross NPAs (total value of NPAs): $10 million
- Provisions (reserve funds for recovering potential losses): $3 million
- NNPA = $10 million - $3 million = $7 million
- This means the bank has $7 million of NPAs after considering provisions.


## Key Points

- Banks aim to keep GNPA and NNPA ratios low.
- High GNPA/NNPA ratios indicate potential financial distress.
- Investors and regulators monitor these metrics to assess a bank stability.

## NPA Impact

- **Lower NPAs** -> **Better loan portfolio quality** -> **Stronger stock market sentiment** -> **Stock price improvement**.


**Understanding these classifications and risk factors helps banks effectively manage credit risk and maintain financial stability.**
