# Overview  

This document outlines the steps for building a **Credit Risk Modeling** pipeline, covering data preprocessing, feature selection, model evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and performance improvement strategies.  

## **Steps for Credit Risk Modeling**  

1. **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and detect outliers to determine whether they are genuine outliers or data errors.  

2. **Decide how to encode categorical variables.**  

3. **Handle class imbalance** by determining appropriate loss metrics for model evaluation.  

4. **Test various classification algorithms** to identify the best-performing model on the original dataset (without feature selection).  

6. **Perform feature selection** using the best classification algorithm while avoiding **data leakage** and ensuring **Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation** (due to class imbalance).  

   - **Gradient Boosting Feature Importance**  
   - **Random Forest Feature Importance**  
   - **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**  
   - **Permutation Importance**  

7. **Assess whether removing features with high Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) impacts model performance.**  

8. **Use filter methods** to further reduce features and evaluate the impact on model performance.  

9. **Verify if any feature may cause data leakage.**  

10. **After selecting the best features, evaluate model performance** using **Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation**, ensuring data leakage is avoided.  

11. **Test whether applying transformations** (e.g., **Standardization, Power transformation**) improves model performance.  

12. **Create a pipeline** that includes all preprocessing steps, feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and final model building.  

13. **Evaluate model performance on unseen data.**  

14. **Analyze underfitting and overfitting** using **Mlxtend bias-variance tradeoff**.  

15. **Future Scope:**  
    - **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Will soon start learning and implementing it for model interpretability.  

# **Conclusion**  
By following these structured steps, a robust credit risk model can be developed, ensuring effective risk assessment while minimizing biases, improving predictive accuracy, and optimizing model performance.
