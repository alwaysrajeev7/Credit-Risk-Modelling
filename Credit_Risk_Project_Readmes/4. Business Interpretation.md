# Business Interpretation

## 1. Understanding Risk Appetite & Business Strategy

The risk appetite of the business determines how aggressively loans should be approved based on priority levels. 
It is directly linked to the company’s financial targets and growth strategy.

| **Risk Appetite** | **Business Target Status** | **Loan Approval Focus**                                                            |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Low**           | Targets already achieved   | Approve only **P1** (Lowest risk, highest creditworthiness)                        |
| **High**          | Targets are far away       | Approve **P1, P2, P3** (Balanced risk-taking for growth)                           |
| **Very High**     | Targets are very far away  | Approve **P1, P2, P3, P4** (Aggressive loan distribution with high-risk tolerance) |


## 2. Business Decision-Making Based on Risk Appetite

- **Low Risk Appetite** -> **Focus on quality over volume**, ensuring minimal defaults and strong portfolio health.
- **High Risk Appetite** -> **Expand lending** to P2 and P3 applicants to capture growth while maintaining a reasonable risk.
- **Very High Risk Appetite** -> **Maximize approvals**, even for P4 applicants, prioritizing market expansion despite higher default risks.


## 3. Feedback Loop for Model Evolution & Relabeling

The model should continuously evolve based on **real-time feedback** from the **business segment department** and **loan department** to ensure it remains aligned with changing risk patterns and business goals.


### How Feedback is Incorporated into Model Evolution

1. **Performance Evaluation:** Compare **model-predicted priority levels (P1–P4) vs. actual loan outcomes**.

2. **Business Feedback:**
   - Insights from **loan officers** on real-world applicant behavior.

3. **Row Relabeling:** Adjust **P1–P4 classifications** based on new risk insights:
   - If many **P1-approved** loans default, some borderline P1 cases are reclassified as P2.
   - If **P3 loans perform well**, some may be relabeled as P2 for future predictions.
   - **High-risk P4 approvals** with high defaults may trigger stricter P3-P4 segmentation.

4. **Model Retraining:** Use the updated dataset with relabeled priority levels to improve accuracy.
