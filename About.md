### Credit Risk Modeling

**Definition:** Credit risk modeling is the process of using statistical models and machine learning techniques to assess the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan.

**Importance:**

- Helps banks minimize financial risks.
- Improves loan approval processes.
- Enhances overall risk management strategies.

### Credit Scoring

**Definition:** A method used by banks to evaluate a borrowerâ€™s creditworthiness based on various factors like income, past credit behavior, and loan repayment history and many more.


**Common Machine Learning Algorithms for Credit Scoring Models:**

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)


### Machine Learning in Credit Risk

- **Supervised Learning:** Used for classification (default vs. non-default) and regression (predicting risk scores).
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Used for detecting fraud and anomalies in loan applications.


### Conclusion

Credit risk modeling is essential for banks to mitigate potential financial losses. By leveraging machine learning, banks can improve their risk assessment capabilities, 
enhance decision-making, and maintain a stable financial environment.
